				 application-package
						 the name of your application package as defined in the manifest. Used by the
						 'uninstall' rule.
				 source-folder
						 the name of the source folder. Default is 'src'.
				 out-folder
						 the name of the output folder. Default is 'bin'.

				 Properties related to the SDK location or the project target should be updated
					using the 'android' tool with the 'update' action.

				 This file is an integral part of the build system for your application and
				 should be checked in in Version Control Systems.
